Multitasking:
-------------
1: Executing several tasks simultaneously is the concept of multitasking.
2: There are two types of multitasking:

(I)Process based multitasking
(II)Thread based multitasking

Process based multitasking:
---------------------------
            Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent program(process) is called process based multitasking.
Ex: While typing a java a program in the editor we can listen audio songs from the system, at the same time we can download a file from internet. all these tasks will be executed simultaneously and independent of each other hence it is process based multi tasking. Process based multitasking us best suitable at OS level.

Thread based multitasking:
---------------------------
            Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent part of the same program is called thread based multitasking. And each independent part is called a thread. Thread based multitasking is best suitable at programmatic level.
            
Note: 
1: Whether it is process based or thread based the main objective of multitasking is to reduce response time of the system and to improve performence.
2: The main important application area are:
   To develop multimedia graphics
   To develop animations
   To develop video games
   To develop web servers and application servers etc.
3: When compare with old languages developing multithreaded application in java is very easy , because java provides inbuilt support for mutithreading with rich API(Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup ...).
