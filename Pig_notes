===================================================================Pig script & use cases====================================================================
1: Load data from file
file_data = LOAD 'file.txt<with full path>' using PigStorage(',') as (id:int, name:chararray);

2: Load data from hive table
table_data = Load 'vivekyadav.orders' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader() as (order_id:int, order_date:chararray, order_customer_id:int, order_status:chararray);

3: Store data into hive table
STORE table_data into 'vivekyadav.pig_temp_data' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();

4: Diagnostic operators in pig latin:
>Dump
>Describe
>Explain
>Illustrate

5: Use group function:
driver_data = LOAD 'driver.csv' using PigStorage as (schema);
group_data = GROUP driver_data by location;
group_data = GROUP driver_data by All(we group by using all fields);
dump group_data;
describe group_data;
illustrate group_data;

6: Use of join
data1 having primary key is id
data2 having primary key is emp_id
data1_join_data2 = JOIN data1 by id LEFT JOIN,data2 by emp_id;

7:Use of CROSS : It will return the cortesian product of the two relations
data1 having 3 records
data2 having 4 records
data1-cross_data2 = CROSS data1,data2; --> result will be having 12 records.

8: Use of UNION : It will merge the records of the identical relations
data1_union_data2 = UNION data1,data2;

9: Use of SPLIT : It will split one relation into more than 1 relation  as per condition applied.
student_split = SPLIT student into student1 if age>21, student2 if (22<age and age<28); --> So it will return 2 splited relation from student.

10: Use of FILTER : It used to select the required tuples from the relation based on condition.
student_data_by_location = FILTER student by location='Gurgaon';

11: Use of DISTINCT : It is used to remove the redundant records from the relation.
distinct_records = DISTINCT student;

12: Use of FOREACH : It used to generate the specified data transformation over full data
student_specified = FOREACH student generate id,age,city;

13: Use of ORDER BY : It is used to sort th records
student = ORDER student BY (ASC|DESC)

14: Use of LIMIT : It used to apply limit over full set of records
student = LIMIT student 10;

15: Use of AVG() function : It is used to calculate the average.
student_group_all = GROUP student all;
student_avg_age = FOREACH student_group_all generate (student.id,student.name), AVG(student.age)

16: Use of COUNT() : It used to count the no of records
student_count = FOREACH student generate COUNT(student.id);
